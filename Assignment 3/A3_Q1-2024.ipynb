    "# Computer Vision 2024 Assignment 3: Deep Learning for Perception Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment contains 2 questions. The first question probes understanding of deep learning for classification. The second question is a more challenging classification experiment on a larger dataset. Answer the questions in separate Python notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1: A simple classifier, 20 marks\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we provide demo code showing how to train a network on a small dataset called [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). Please run through the code \"tutorial-style\" to get a sense of what it is doing. Then use the code alongside lecture notes and other resources to understand how to use pytorch libraries to implement, train and use a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Fashion-MNIST dataset the lables from 0-9 correspond to various clothing classes so you might find it convenient to create a python list as follows:\n",

    "               'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle boot']\n",
